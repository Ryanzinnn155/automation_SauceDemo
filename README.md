<h1>Automation with PlayWright</h1>

<h3>What happens during the code?<h3/>
<p>
This was an Automation made in PlayWright, my first project automating the purchase of an item within a “Store”, the website was designed to carry out these tests and in the end an error occurred, it is normal for the Website!
The Code logs in to the website with the users and passwords allowed by the website, then enters the store, adds an item to the cart and goes to check out to finalize the purchase!
